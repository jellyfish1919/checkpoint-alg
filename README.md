### Data Structures & Sorting Algorithms I Need to Master

#### **Data Structures:**
1. **Tries:**  
   - Limited practice with real-world use cases like autocomplete or prefix matching.  
2. **Graphs (Advanced Algorithms):**  
   - Struggle with algorithms like Dijkstra's and Kruskal's for pathfinding and spanning trees.  
3. **Heaps:**  
   - Need better understanding of heap operations like `heapify` and practical scenarios for their use.

---

#### **Sorting Algorithms:**
1. **Radix Sort:**  
   - Unfamiliar with implementation details and when to prefer it over comparison-based algorithms.  
2. **Counting Sort:**  
   - Struggle with applying it to datasets with large ranges of values.  
3. **Bucket Sort:**  
   - Need more clarity on bucket size optimization and handling uneven data distribution.  
4. **Shell Sort:**  
   - Limited understanding of gap sequence optimization and its impact on performance.

### Why Iâ€™m Not Mastering Them:
- Lack of exposure to complex real-world problems requiring these techniques.  
- Limited hands-on practice with edge cases and optimization for efficiency.  
- Need deeper understanding of scenarios where these are preferred over simpler approaches.  

### Plan to Improve:
- Use online visualization tools (like VisuAlgo) to understand the step-by-step behavior of these algorithms.  
- Implement them manually to gain confidence and solve relevant coding problems.  
- Discuss challenges and progress with instructors for additional guidance.
